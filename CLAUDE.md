# PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **Core Principle:** Users own their data completely. Inscript CANNOT access user data — not "won't", but "cannot".

## The Four Pillars

### 1. User Ownership is Absolute
- **Export everything by default** — No paternalistic filtering
- User's exported file = user's responsibility to safeguard
- We don't decide what's "too sensitive" to export — users decide
- Privacy toggles are USER CHOICE, not app decisions

### 2. Inscript Cannot Read User Data
- **True E2E encryption** — Data encrypted client-side with user's keys
- Server stores ciphertext only — Inscript cannot decrypt
- Even if compelled, we cannot produce plaintext
- **AUDIT REQUIRED:** Verify current encryption is client-side, not server-side

### 3. Zero-Retention AI Providers Only
- LLM API calls must use providers that don't train on inputs
- **Approved:** Anthropic API, OpenAI API (both have zero-retention policies)
- **AUDIT REQUIRED:** Document all LLM touchpoints and verify retention policies
- Never use consumer-facing AI (ChatGPT web, Claude web) for user data

### 4. No Logging of Content
- Log IDs, timestamps, error codes — never content
- No user notes, messages, or entity names in logs
- **AUDIT REQUIRED:** Review all logging statements

## Privacy Audit Checklist (Verified January 27, 2026)

| Area | Question | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Encryption | Is encryption client-side (user keys) or server-side (Inscript keys)? | ✅ AES-256-GCM client-side |
| LLM Providers | Are all LLM calls to zero-retention APIs? | ✅ Anthropic + OpenAI API only |
| Logging | Do any logs contain user content? | ✅ Metadata only (510 calls audited) |
| RLS | Do all tables have row-level security? | ✅ All 37 tables verified |
| Export | Can users export 100% of their data? | ✅ Phase 18 |
| API Keys | Are all secrets in environment variables? | ✅ No hardcoded secrets |

## Security Audit (January 30, 2026)

**26 API routes secured** — All routes now require Bearer token authentication + CORS restricted.

| Route Category | Routes Fixed | Risk Before | Fix Applied |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Data Access** | 7 routes | IDOR — attacker could access other users' data | Verify token + use `user.id` from auth |
| **AI/LLM** | 8 routes | API credit abuse | Require Bearer token |
| **Knowledge Graph** | 1 route | SQL filter injection | Input sanitization |
| **Edge Runtime** | 10 routes | CORS wildcard + no auth | CORS allowlist + token verification |

**Standard API Routes Secured:**
- `/api/tiered-retrieval.js`, `/api/memory-retrieve.js`, `/api/hybrid-retrieval.js`
- `/api/memory-search.js`, `/api/memory-consolidate.js`, `/api/extract-entities.js`
- `/api/patterns.js`, `/api/extract.js`
- `/api/classify-importance.js`, `/api/infer-connections.js`, `/api/compress-memory.js`
- `/api/vision.js`, `/api/refine.js`, `/api/classify-feedback.js`
- `/api/synthesize-query.js`, `/api/assemble-context.js`

**Edge Runtime Routes Secured:**
- `/api/enhance-note.js`, `/api/enhance-meeting.js`, `/api/process-ambient.js`
- `/api/transcribe-voice.js`, `/api/upload-audio-chunk.js`, `/api/analyze-edge.js`
- `/api/inscript-context.js`, `/api/query-meetings.js`, `/api/chat.js`, `/api/embed.js`

**Auth Pattern (Standard Runtime):**
```javascript
const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authorization required' });
}
const token = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '');
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token);
if (error || !user) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
// Use user.id — NEVER trust userId from request body
```

**Auth Pattern (Edge Runtime):**
```javascript
import { getCorsHeaders, handlePreflightEdge } from './lib/cors-edge.js';
import { requireAuthEdge } from './lib/auth-edge.js';

const corsHeaders = getCorsHeaders(req);
const preflightResponse = handlePreflightEdge(req);
if (preflightResponse) return preflightResponse;

const { user, errorResponse } = await requireAuthEdge(req, corsHeaders);
if (errorResponse) return errorResponse;
const userId = user.id;
```

**Shared Utilities:**
- `/api/lib/auth.js` — `requireAuth()` for standard runtime
- `/api/lib/auth-edge.js` — `requireAuthEdge()` for Edge runtime
- `/api/lib/cors-edge.js` — `getCorsHeaders()`, `handlePreflightEdge()` for Edge runtime

## What This Means for Development

**ALWAYS:**
- Use RLS on every new table
- Use service role key only in API routes, never client
- Encrypt sensitive fields client-side
- Verify LLM provider retention policies

**NEVER:**
- Log user content (notes, messages, entity names)
- Use consumer AI interfaces for user data
- Make privacy decisions for users
- Store plaintext when encryption is possible

**Future Sprint:** Complete Privacy Architecture Audit
- Trace all data flows
- Verify E2E encryption implementation
- Document LLM provider policies
- Audit all logging

# STRATEGIC DIRECTION

> **Core Thesis:** Inscript is a Personal Knowledge Graph.
> Notes are input. The graph is the product. Your identity, portable anywhere.

## The Architecture Insight

**Inscript is NOT a note-taking app.** It's a system that transforms unstructured notes into a structured knowledge graph representing YOU.

```
User Input → Entity Extraction → Knowledge Graph → Context for AI
   ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
  Notes      "Marcus works      Nodes + Edges      MIRROR knows
             at Anthropic"      + Properties       your world
```

**Traditional RAG:** Chunks documents → embeds → vector search → retrieves similar text.

**Inscript's Model:** Extracts knowledge → builds graph → traverses relationships → loads structured context.

The difference: RAG finds *similar text*. Inscript understands *your world*.

## Knowledge Graph Architecture

| Component | What It Is | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Nodes** | Entities (people, projects, topics) | Marcus, Anthropic, AI Strategy |
| **Edges** | Relationships between entities | Marcus → works_at → Anthropic |
| **Properties** | Attributes on nodes | importance: 0.9, sentiment: +0.7 |
| **Facts** | SPO triples (Subject-Predicate-Object) | User → trusts_opinion_of → Marcus |
| **Behaviors** | User's relationship TO entities | seeks_advice_from, admires, avoids |

**The Behavioral Layer** is what makes this a *Personal* Knowledge Graph. It's not just "Marcus works at Anthropic" — it's "I trust Marcus's opinion on AI strategy."

## What We're Building Toward

| Horizon | Capability | Value |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Now** | Graph-based retrieval | Better context than vector search |
| **H1** | Graph inference | "Who else might have insight on this?" |
| **H2** | Temporal reasoning | "How has my view of X evolved?" |
| **H3** | Multi-user graphs | Shared team knowledge graphs |
| **H4** | Protocol standard | Any AI can read your graph (PAMP v2.0) |

## The Vision

**What Inscript provides:**
1. **You own it** — Your graph, encrypted with your keys
2. **You can leave** — Export your complete knowledge graph, take it anywhere
3. **We can't see it** — True E2E encryption means we cannot read your data
4. **Any AI can use it** — PAMP v2.0 export works with ChatGPT, Claude, any AI

**Why this matters:**
- Today: AI apps lock in your data. You lose everything if you leave.
- With Inscript: Your knowledge graph is portable. Export it. Take it anywhere.

**Inscript's moat:** Being the best place to BUILD your knowledge graph — not the only place you can USE it.

## Data Architecture (5 Layers)

| Layer | Name | What It Stores | Inscript Tables |
|-------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **1** | Core Identity | Profile, communication style, values | `onboarding_data`, `user_profiles`, `user_key_people` |
| **2** | Knowledge Graph | Entities, facts, relationships | `user_entities`, `entity_facts`, `entity_relationships` |
| **3** | Episodic Memory | Notes, conversations, events | `notes`, `mirror_conversations`, `mirror_messages`, `meetings` |
| **4** | Procedural Memory | Patterns, behaviors, habits | `user_patterns`, `category_summaries` |
| **5** | Graph Indexes | Relationship traversal, co-occurrence | `entity_mentions`, `note_entities`, `entity_links` |

> **Note:** Vector embeddings are deprecated (v9.14.0). Graph traversal provides better context than vector similarity for personal memory.

## Strategic Phases

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Consumer Love | ✅ Complete — App people can't live without |
| **Phase 2** | Portable Export | ✅ Complete — Full data export with structured facts |
| **Phase 3** | Zero-Knowledge | ✅ Complete — E2E encryption, BYOK, PAMP v2.0 |
| **Phase 4** | Export Enrichment | 🔄 Current — Cognitive memory signals for external AI agents |
| **Phase 5** | Platform APIs | Next — Let developers build on Inscript |
| **Phase 6** | Protocol Standard | Future — PAMP becomes the open standard |

## Guiding Principles

1. **Knowledge graph first** — Notes are input, the graph is the product
2. **User ownership is absolute** — Users can export everything, anytime
3. **Privacy by architecture** — We cannot access user data, not just "won't"
4. **Earn loyalty through experience** — Not through lock-in
5. **Graph over vectors** — Relationships beat similarity for personal memory

# KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION PIPELINE (v9.15.0)

## Unified Input Router

ALL user inputs flow through a single extraction pipeline:

```
User Input → Input Router → AI Extraction → Knowledge Store → Graph
    ↓                              ↓              ↓
notes, profile,            Claude Haiku    Deduplication
key_people, MIRROR,        extracts:       + Merge
settings, onboarding       entities, facts,
                           behaviors, topics
```

**Key file:** `/lib/extraction/input-router.js`

| Input Type | What Gets Extracted |
|------------|---------------------|
| `note` | Entities, facts, behaviors, topics from note content |
| `meeting` | Same as note, with meeting context |
| `profile` | AI-extracts from free text fields (depth_answer, life_context) |
| `key_person` | Converts relationship to behavioral predicates |
| `mirror` | Extracts from user messages in conversation |
| `settings` | Logged only (settings stored in user_settings table) |

## Cascade Soft-Delete

When a note is deleted, associated knowledge is automatically marked inactive:

```
Note deleted → Trigger fires → entity_facts.status = 'inactive'
                            → user_behaviors.status = 'inactive'
```

**Key file:** `/supabase/migrations/20260130_knowledge_cascade_delete.sql`

MIRROR only loads `status='active'` data, so deleted content doesn't affect UX.

## Extraction Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/lib/extraction/input-router.js` | Routes all inputs to extraction |
| `/lib/extraction/extractor.js` | AI extraction with Claude Haiku |
| `/lib/extraction/knowledge-store.js` | Stores with deduplication |
| `/lib/extraction/profile-converter.js` | Profile → SPO triples |
| `/api/extract-knowledge.js` | Unified POST endpoint |
| `/js/knowledge-extraction.js` | Client-side event hooks |

# KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ARCHITECTURE (v9.9.0)

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph is the unified hub for ALL user data. Every input flows through here, gets connected, and nothing is siloed.

## Core Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ingestInput(userId, input)` | Process any input (note, meeting, MIRROR, onboarding) |
| `getFullContext(userId, query)` | Retrieve unified context for MIRROR |
| `enhancedExtraction(userId, content)` | LLM-powered intent-aware extraction |
| `getUserBehaviors(userId)` | Get user's behavioral profile |
| `getEntityQualities(userId)` | Get how entities relate to user |

## Input Types

| Type | Source | What Gets Extracted |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| `note` | Quick notes, saved notes | Entities, facts, relationships, **behaviors** |
| `meeting` | Meeting mode | Entities, attendees, action items |
| `mirror_message` | MIRROR conversations | Entities mentioned |
| `onboarding` | Setup flow | User profile, preferences |
| `voice` | Voice recordings | Transcribed entities |

## Database Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `user_inputs` | Track ALL inputs | input_type, source_id, content_preview |
| `entity_mentions` | Context where entities appear | entity_id, source_type, context_snippet |
| `entity_links` | Entity co-occurrence | entity_a, entity_b, strength |
| `note_entities` | Link notes to entities | note_id, entity_id |
| `user_behaviors` | **Phase 19** User → Entity relationships | predicate, entity_name, topic, sentiment |
| `entity_qualities` | **Phase 19** Entity → User relationships | entity_name, predicate, object |

## Intent-Aware Extraction (Phase 19)

Goes beyond extracting NOUNS to extract USER'S RELATIONSHIP to entities.

**Current (basic):**
```
"Marcus helped me think through the AI strategy"
→ Marcus (Entity) → works_at → Anthropic (Fact)
```

**Intent-Aware (advanced):**
```
→ Marcus (Entity) → works_at → Anthropic (Fact)
→ User → trusts_opinion_of → Marcus (Behavior)
→ User → seeks_advice_from → Marcus [topic: AI strategy] (Behavior)
→ Marcus → helps_with → strategic_thinking (Quality)
```

### Behavioral Predicates (User → Entity)

| Predicate | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| `trusts_opinion_of` | User trusts Marcus on technical decisions |
| `seeks_advice_from` | User asks Sarah about product strategy |
| `inspired_by` | User inspired by Paul Graham's writing |
| `relies_on` | User relies on Mom for emotional support |
| `conflicted_about` | User conflicted about job offer |
| `learns_from` | User learns ML from Marcus |

### Quality Predicates (Entity → User)

| Predicate | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| `helps_with` | Marcus helps with strategic thinking |
| `challenges` | Sarah challenges assumptions |
| `supports` | Mom supports emotionally |
| `mentors` | Marcus mentors on AI |

## Key Files

- `/js/knowledge-graph.js` — Central knowledge hub
- `/api/extract-entities.js` — LLM extraction with intent-awareness
- `/api/save-behaviors.js` — Persist behaviors and qualities

## Integration Points

- **Note save** (`encrypted-db.js`): Auto-ingests after save
- **Meeting save** (`work-ui.js`): Auto-ingests with attendees
- **Onboarding** (`onboarding.js`): Ingests profile data
- **MIRROR**: Uses `getFullContext()` with behaviors for unified retrieval

# PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE (v9.8.3)

## Two-Tier Model

| Tier | Price | Notes | AI | Limits | We See |
|------|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| **Managed** | $10/mo | Encrypted | Proxied (not stored) | 500 MIRROR calls/mo (soft cap) | AI conversations (never logged) |
| **BYOK** | $5/mo + API | Encrypted | Direct to Anthropic | Unlimited | Nothing |

**Messaging:** "Notes are encrypted — we can't read them. AI conversations pass through our servers but are never stored or logged."

## Client-Side Encryption

All user content is encrypted with AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API before upload.

**Key Derivation:**
- User password → PBKDF2 (100k iterations, SHA-256) → AES-256 key
- Key NEVER leaves browser
- Recovery key generated at setup (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX format)

**Encrypted Database Columns:**

All content tables have `*_encrypted` TEXT column + `is_encrypted` BOOLEAN flag.

| Table | Encrypted Columns | Plaintext Kept? |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| notes | content_encrypted | No |
| user_entities | name_encrypted, summary_encrypted | No |
| entity_facts | object_encrypted | predicate stays plaintext |
| user_patterns | description_encrypted | category stays plaintext |
| mirror_messages | content_encrypted | No |
| mirror_conversations | title_encrypted | No |
| category_summaries | summary_encrypted | No |
| meeting_history | title_encrypted, notes_encrypted | No |
| ambient_recordings | transcript_encrypted | No |

**Key Files:**
- `/js/encryption.js` — Core AES-256-GCM functions
- `/js/key-manager.js` — Key lifecycle (setup, unlock, lock, recovery)
- `/js/encrypted-db.js` — Database operations with auto encrypt/decrypt
- `/js/api-client.js` — AI calls (BYOK direct / Managed proxy)
- `/js/tier-manager.js` — Tier info and switching
- `/js/onboarding-encryption.js` — Encryption setup flow
- `/js/privacy-indicator.js` — Header privacy badge
- `/api/lib/cors.js` — Shared CORS utility (allowed origins, preflight handling)

## Zero-Knowledge Guarantees

**Managed Tier:**
1. Notes encrypted client-side before upload
2. We store only ciphertext
3. AI conversations pass through proxy but are NEVER stored or logged
4. We cannot read note content

**BYOK Tier:**
1. Notes encrypted client-side before upload
2. We store only ciphertext
3. AI calls go direct to Anthropic (we don't see them)
4. Complete zero-knowledge — we see nothing

# CONTEXT ENGINEERING (RAG 2.0)

## Task Classification

MIRROR classifies messages to load appropriate context:

| Task Type | Triggers | Context Loaded |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| entity_recall | "what do you know about" | Entity + facts + mentions only |
| decision | "should I", "help me decide" | Values, people, past decisions |
| emotional | "I'm stressed", "feeling" | Patterns, supportive relationships |
| research | "research", "deep dive" | Broad search, all related |
| thinking_partner | "I'm thinking about" | Related notes, thinking patterns |
| factual | "when did", "where does" | Entity + facts only |
| general | (fallback) | Top entities, recent notes |

## Key Files

- `/lib/mirror/task-classifier.js` — Classify messages into task types
- `/lib/mirror/context-strategies.js` — Define what to load per task
- `/lib/mirror/context-loader.js` — Execute context loading
- `/lib/mirror/graph-traversal.js` — Navigate entity relationships
- `/lib/mirror/index.js` — Re-exports

## Graph Traversal

Entities are connected through shared facts:
- Sarah → works_at Anthropic → others at Anthropic
- Person → knows → Other person
- Topic → Notes → Entities mentioned

---

# PHASE 19: POST-RAG ARCHITECTURE (v9.10.0)

## Intent-Aware Extraction

Extract USER'S RELATIONSHIP to entities, not just entity facts.

### Behavioral Predicates (User → Entity)

| Predicate | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `trusts_opinion_of` | User trusts this person's judgment |
| `seeks_advice_from` | User goes to this person for advice |
| `relies_on` | User depends on this entity |
| `learns_from` | User gains knowledge from this entity |
| `inspired_by` | User is inspired by this entity |
| `feels_about` | User has emotional response to entity |
| `conflicted_about` | User has mixed feelings |
| `avoids` | User avoids this entity/topic |
| `collaborates_with` | User works with this entity |
| `competes_with` | User competes with this entity |

### Entity Quality Predicates (Entity → User)

| Predicate | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `helps_with` | Entity helps user with something |
| `challenges` | Entity challenges user |
| `supports` | Entity supports user |
| `mentors` | Entity mentors user |
| `drains` | Entity drains user's energy |
| `energizes` | Entity energizes user |

### Key Files

- `/api/extract-entities.js` — Enhanced extraction with behaviors
- `/api/save-behaviors.js` — Persist behaviors to database
- `/lib/mirror/context-loader.js` — Load behaviors into context
- `/lib/mirror/graph-traversal.js` — Bi-directional relationship inference

## Semantic Distillation

Convert old notes into permanent SPO triples before archiving.

### Why Distillation?

- Old notes become permanent knowledge, not discarded history
- Token budget stays manageable
- Patterns survive beyond the recency window
- "What happened" becomes "what we learned"

### API: `/api/distill-episode.js`

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `list` | Get notes eligible for distillation (older than N days) |
| `distill_note` | Distill a single note by ID |
| `batch` | Distill multiple old notes |
| `preview` | Preview distillation without saving |

### Database Columns (notes table)

- `is_distilled` — Whether note has been distilled
- `distilled_summary` — One-sentence summary from distillation
- `distilled_at` — When distillation occurred

## Full User Profile

Get complete user context for AI systems via `/api/evolve-summary.js`.

### Actions

| Action | Returns |
|--------|---------|
| `get` | Category summaries |
| `full_profile` | Complete user profile (identity, behaviors, patterns, summaries) |
| `evolve_behavioral` | Regenerate behavioral profile from behaviors + qualities |

### Full Profile Structure

```json
{
  "identity": { "name", "role", "goals", "lifeContext", "tone" },
  "keyPeople": [{ "name", "relationship" }],
  "categorySummaries": { "work_life": "...", "relationships": "..." },
  "behavioralProfile": "Prose summary of how user relates to people/things",
  "behaviors": [{ "predicate", "entity", "topic", "sentiment" }],
  "entityQualities": [{ "entity", "predicate", "object" }],
  "patterns": [{ "type", "description", "confidence" }],
  "meta": { "behaviorCount", "qualityCount", "patternCount" }
}
```

## Full Context Loader (Phase 2)

Load entire user memory into context window. No RAG, no retrieval.

### API: GET /api/context/full

| Query Param | Values | Default |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| `format` | `markdown`, `json`, `compact` | `markdown` |
| `focusEntity` | entity name | null |

### Response Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Token-Estimate` | Estimated token count |
| `X-Load-Time-Ms` | Load time in milliseconds |
| `X-Entity-Count` | Number of entities loaded |
| `X-Note-Count` | Number of notes loaded |

### Key Files

- `/lib/context/full-loader.js` — Load complete memory in parallel
- `/lib/context/document-builder.js` — Convert to markdown
- `/lib/context/agent-format.js` — MCP, GPT, Claude formats
- `/api/context/full.js` — API endpoint

### Agent Formats

| Function | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `formatForMCP()` | Model Context Protocol resources |
| `formatAsSystemPrompt()` | Direct LLM system prompt |
| `formatForGPTKnowledge()` | ChatGPT Custom GPT knowledge |
| `formatForClaudeProject()` | Claude Projects knowledge |

## MIRROR Full Context Integration (Phase 3)

MIRROR now supports loading entire user memory instead of RAG retrieval.

### Feature Flag

Set `MIRROR_FULL_CONTEXT=true` in environment to enable full context mode.

```bash
# In .env or Vercel environment
MIRROR_FULL_CONTEXT=true
```

### How It Works

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **RAG (default)** | Task classification → Targeted retrieval → Hybrid context |
| **Full Context** | Load everything → Single markdown document → No retrieval |

### Key Changes (`/api/mirror.js`)

- `loadFullContextForMirror()` — Loads complete memory with configurable limits
- `buildSystemPrompt()` — Uses full context document when enabled
- Backward compatible — RAG mode remains default

### Context Limits (Full Mode)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Notes | 300 max (metadata only, E2E encrypted) |
| Entities | 100 max |
| Conversations | 20 max |
| Patterns | 10 max (confidence > 0.6) |
| Behaviors | 15 max (confidence > 0.5) |

### Cost Implications

| Mode | First Call | Cached | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| RAG | ~$0.03-0.05 | N/A | Small, targeted context |
| Full Context | ~$0.30 | ~$0.06 | Large context, benefits from prompt caching |

Prompt caching (Anthropic feature) reduces costs by 90% on subsequent calls with same context prefix.

## Smart Context Routing (v9.14.0)

Automatically routes between RAG and Full Context based on query complexity.

### Task → Route Mapping

| Task Type | Patterns | Route | Why |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----|
| `decision` | "should I", "help me decide" | Full Context | Needs complete picture |
| `emotional` | "I'm stressed", "struggling" | Full Context | Needs relationship awareness |
| `thinking_partner` | "help me think through" | Full Context | Needs everything |
| `factual` | "when did", "what is the" | RAG | Simple lookup |
| `entity_recall` | "what do you know about" | RAG | Targeted retrieval |
| `research` | "deep dive", "analyze my" | RAG | Search works fine |
| `general` | (default) | RAG | Cheaper |

### User Settings

Users can override in Settings → MIRROR → Context Mode:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Auto (Recommended)** | Smart routing based on query type |
| **Fast** | Always use RAG (lower cost) |
| **Deep** | Always load full memory (most thorough) |

### Key Files

- `/api/mirror.js`: Smart routing logic with `shouldUseFullContext()`
- `/api/user-settings.js`: User preference storage
- `/js/settings.js`: Context mode selector UI
- `/lib/mirror/task-classifier.js`: Query classification

### Cost Impact

| Query Type | Route | Cost |
|------------|-------|------|
| "What's Marcus's email?" | RAG | ~$0.03 |
| "Help me decide about this job" | Full Context | ~$0.30 (first), ~$0.06 (cached) |

Best of both worlds: cheap for simple queries, thorough for complex ones.

## PAMP v2.0 Standard (Phase 5)

Portable AI Memory Protocol — the open standard for AI memory portability.

### Specification

Full spec at `/docs/PAMP-v2.0-SPEC.md`

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/docs/PAMP-v2.0-SPEC.md` | Full protocol specification |
| `/lib/pamp/validator.js` | Validate PAMP documents |
| `/lib/pamp/index.js` | Module exports |
| `/api/import.js` | Import memories from other tools |
| `/api/export.js` | Export in PAMP v2.0 format |

### Export API

```
GET /api/export?format=pamp
GET /api/export?format=legacy  (old format)
```

### Import API

```
POST /api/import
Body: PAMP v2.0 JSON document

Query params:
  mode: 'merge' (default) | 'replace'
  dry_run: 'true' | 'false'
```

### PAMP Document Structure

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://pamp.ai/schema/v2",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "identity": { profile, communication, keyPeople },
  "knowledgeGraph": { entities, relationships, coOccurrences },
  "episodes": { notes, conversations, meetings },
  "patterns": [...],
  "summaries": { byCategory, behavioralProfile },
  "meta": { exportedAt, source, counts }
}
```

### GTM Value

- **Import from anywhere** — Users can bring memories from other AI tools
- **Export to anywhere** — Take your data to ChatGPT, Claude, any AI
- **Open standard** — Not locked into Inscript
- **Validation** — Ensure data integrity on import

## Embedding Deprecation (Phase 4)

Embeddings are deprecated in favor of full context loading.

### What Changed

| Component | Old | New |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| `/api/embed.js` | Active | Deprecated (logs warnings) |
| Vector search | Weight: 0.4 | Weight: 0 (skipped) |
| Graph traversal | Weight: 0.3 | Weight: 0.5 |
| Direct lookup | Weight: 0.3 | Weight: 0.5 |

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Skip vector search entirely (default: true)
SKIP_VECTOR_SEARCH=true

# Disable embedding generation
DISABLE_EMBEDDINGS=true
```

### Migration Path

1. Set `MIRROR_FULL_CONTEXT=true` to use full context loading
2. Vector search is automatically skipped
3. Embeddings still work for backward compatibility
4. Future: Remove `note_embeddings` table

# PHASE 20: EXPORT ENRICHMENT — COGNITIVE MEMORY (Planned)

## Strategic Framing

> **Inscript is a portable AI memory system.** Users capture memory in Inscript and export it to ANY AI agent — ChatGPT, Claude, local LLMs, physical robots. Export quality is the moat.

**Two value propositions:**
1. **Internal:** MIRROR for personal reflection + self-understanding
2. **External:** Export to any AI agent with rich, actionable memory data

## What Export Needs (Beyond Raw Data)

External AI agents need signals that raw facts don't provide:

| Signal | Why Agents Need It | Current | Planned |
|--------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| **Retrieval frequency** | Know what user accesses most | ❌ | `retrieval_count` + `last_retrieved_at` |
| **Consolidation tier** | Distinguish raw observation vs confirmed knowledge | ❌ | `is_consolidated` flag |
| **Emotional salience** | Know what matters emotionally to user | Partial (`sentiment_average`) | `emotional_weight` (valence × arousal) |
| **Belief history** | Show how thinking evolved | ✅ (bi-temporal) | `previous_values` in export |

## Planned Schema Changes

### Migration: Export Enrichment Columns

```sql
-- entity_facts enrichment
ALTER TABLE entity_facts
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS retrieval_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_retrieved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_consolidated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS emotional_weight FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0;

-- user_entities emotional dimensions
ALTER TABLE user_entities
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS valence FLOAT,   -- -1 (unpleasant) to 1 (pleasant)
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS arousal FLOAT;   -- 0 (calm) to 1 (intense)
```

## Planned RPC Functions

### Evolution Queries

```sql
-- get_belief_evolution(user_id, entity_id, predicate)
-- Returns: version history showing how a belief changed over time
-- Uses: bi-temporal data (valid_from, valid_to, version, previous_version_id)
```

### Weighted Retrieval

```sql
-- get_weighted_facts(user_id, entity_id, limit)
-- Returns: facts ranked by confidence × log(retrieval_count) × recency
-- Side effect: increments retrieval_count on returned facts
```

### Emotional Context

```sql
-- get_entities_by_mood(user_id, target_sentiment, tolerance)
-- Returns: entities matching emotional state
-- Enables: "When was I last excited about something?"
```

## PAMP v2.0 Export Enhancement

```json
{
  "facts": [{
    "predicate": "works_at",
    "object": "Anthropic",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "consolidation": "semantic",
    "retrieval_score": 0.87,
    "emotional_weight": 1.8,
    "valid_from": "2025-06-01",
    "version": 2,
    "previous_values": ["Google"]
  }]
}
```

## Differentiation from Mem0

| Dimension | Mem0 | Inscript |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Memory for their agents | Memory you own, portable to ANY agent |
| **Emotional context** | None | Valence/arousal weighting |
| **Belief history** | Stores current state | Tracks evolution over time |
| **Export quality** | Basic | Rich signals (consolidation, retrieval score, emotional weight) |
| **Data ownership** | Platform-locked | E2E encrypted, user-owned, exportable |

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Feature | Dependencies |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Schema migration (new columns) | None |
| 2 | Track retrieval in context loader | Phase 1 |
| 3 | Emotional tagging during extraction | Phase 1 |
| 4 | Evolution queries RPC | Bi-temporal (already deployed) |
| 5 | PAMP v2.0 export update | Phases 1-4 |

## Key Principles

- **Never delete user data** — Use decay for retrieval ranking, not deletion
- **Export everything** — Let the consuming agent decide relevance
- **Enrich, don't complicate** — New fields are additive, not breaking

# PRODUCT TEAM PERSONAS

**Use these personas when facing ambiguity. Ask: "What would [Persona] say?"**

## Maya Chen — CPO (Product Decisions)

**Background:** Ex-Notion, ex-Linear. Ruthless prioritization.

**Maya's Red Lines:**
- No feature that doesn't integrate with entity extraction
- No UI requiring > 2 clicks to start
- No enhancement > 3 seconds
- No settings screens — smart defaults only
- **NEW:** No paternalistic privacy decisions — let users choose

**When to invoke:** Scope decisions, "should we build X?" questions

---

## David Okonkwo — Principal Engineer (Technical Decisions)

**Background:** Ex-Vercel, ex-Stripe. Performance obsessed.

**David's Principles:**
- Edge Runtime for all API routes (no cold starts)
- Parallel fetches for context gathering
- Streaming responses for perceived speed
- Background processing via `ctx.waitUntil()`
- **NEW:** Zero-retention LLM providers only
- **NEW:** Client-side encryption for sensitive data

**When to invoke:** Architecture decisions, performance concerns, privacy architecture

---

## Sasha Volkov — Head of Design (UI Decisions)

**Background:** Ex-Apple HI team, ex-Figma. Editorial obsessed.

**Sasha's Red Lines:**
- Black, white, silver ONLY
- Black for buttons ONLY — no black backgrounds
- No shadows on cards
- No rounded corners > 2px
- Typography creates hierarchy, not boxes

**When to invoke:** UI decisions, visual design, "how should this look?"

---

# CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER read ui.js in full** — Use grep only
2. **Always use onboarding data** in first reflection
3. **Key People have highest priority** — Reference by name with relationship
4. **Callbacks are critical** — Reference previous notes by note 2-3
5. **Entity mentions must feel natural** — Never "Based on my database..."
6. **Privacy is ARCHITECTURAL** — We cannot access user data, not just "won't"
7. **Design is editorial** — Black, white, silver. Typography-first.
8. **Test mobile** — Responsive design is required
9. **Enhancement < 3 seconds** — Performance is non-negotiable
10. **Consult personas** — Maya (product), David (tech), Sasha (design)
11. **Export-first thinking** — Every feature should support data portability
12. **Zero-retention LLMs** — Only use API providers that don't train on inputs
13. **Never log content** — IDs and timestamps only, never user data
