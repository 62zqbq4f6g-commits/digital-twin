DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - black/white/gray only.

IMAGE STORAGE AND DISPLAY FIX:

1. COMPRESS IMAGE BEFORE PROCESSING:
   - Max 1024px width/height
   - JPEG quality 70%
   - Target: under 300KB per image

2. SAVE IMAGE TO NOTE:
   - Store compressed base64 in note.imageData
   - Save alongside existing analysis

3. DISPLAY IMAGE IN NOTE DETAIL:
   - Show image at top of note detail (below title, above Description)
   - HTML: <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,${note.imageData}" />
   - Style: width 100%, max-height 300px, object-fit cover, subtle border
   - Only show if note.imageData exists

4. SYNC TO CLOUD:
   - Include imageData in Supabase sync payload
   - Restore on app load from cloud

5. SHOW THUMBNAIL IN NOTES LIST:
   - Small thumbnail (60x60px) next to note title in list view
   - Only for notes with images

TEST: 
- Upload photo → photo visible in note detail
- Clear cache → reload → photo still visible

Deploy and output IMAGE-DISPLAY-FIXED
