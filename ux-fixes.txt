DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - clean, elegant, typography-forward, black/white/gray only.

FIXES NEEDED:

1. CLOUD SYNC CRITICAL: All user data must sync to Supabase and reload after cache clear:
   - Notes, feedback, comments, patterns, decisions
   - On app start, fetch from cloud if local is empty
   - Test: clear cache, reload, all data should restore

2. REBUILD PROFILE UX: Show elegant loading state during pattern detection:
   - Button changes to "Analyzing..." with subtle animation
   - Show progress: "Analyzing 15 of 23 notes..."
   - Disable button while processing
   - Smooth transition when patterns appear

3. DECISION STATE NOT SAVING: When user clicks Still Thinking or Decided:
   - Save to note.analysis.decision.resolved (true/false)
   - Save note.analysis.decision.resolvedAt timestamp
   - Visually show which was selected (highlight the active button)
   - Persist across refresh
   - If Decided, remove from Thinking Through section

4. ACTION CHECKBOXES: When user checks an action item:
   - Save checked state to note.analysis.actionsCompleted array
   - Persist across refresh
   - Show checked state on reload

5. LOGO: Replace "Digital Twin" header with "roxthebox" in lowercase
   - Use elegant minimalist font (Inter 300 weight or similar)
   - Letter-spacing: 0.15em
   - Contemporary fashion brand aesthetic
