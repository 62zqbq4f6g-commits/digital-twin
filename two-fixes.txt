DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - black/white/gray only.

TWO FIXES:

1. STILL THINKING NOT SHOWING IN THINKING THROUGH:
   - When user clicks "Still Thinking", note should appear in "Thinking Through" section on TWIN tab
   - Logic: Show notes where analysis.decision.isDecision=true AND (decision.resolved=false OR decision.status='thinking')
   - Currently only showing unresolved decisions, not ones marked "Still Thinking"
   - TEST: click Still Thinking on decision note → go to TWIN tab → note appears in Thinking Through

2. PHOTO UPLOAD BROKEN:
   - Image capture/upload not working
   - Debug: check console for errors when posting photo
   - Verify image processing pipeline still functional
   - TEST: tap image icon → take/select photo → note creates with image analysis

Deploy and output TWO-FIXES-COMPLETE
