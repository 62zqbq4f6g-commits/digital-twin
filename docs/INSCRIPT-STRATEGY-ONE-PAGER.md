# INSCRIPT STRATEGY — ONE PAGER

## Core Thesis

> **We're building the memory layer for personal AI.**
> Consumer-first. Platform-second. Trust-always.

---

## The Belief

The AI that **knows you** will always beat the AI that's **smarter**.

Big Tech builds assistants that execute intents. We build the layer that makes every assistant understand who you're talking about.

## Non-Negotiables

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Privacy is the product** | Never train on user data. Delete means delete. |
| **Portability is power** | Users own their memory. Full export always. |
| **Trust is earned daily** | No vaporware. Admit mistakes. Ship promises. |
| **People over productivity** | Relationships > tasks. Marcus > "buy milk." |

## The Moat Progression

```
YEAR 1              YEAR 2              YEAR 3+
Consumer Love  →    Data Gravity   →    Platform Lock-in
"Can't live         "Knows me too       "Everything uses
without it"         well to switch"     my Inscript"
```

## Strategic Phases

| Phase | Timeline | Goal | North Star |
|-------|----------|------|------------|
| **1. Consumer Love** | Mo 1-6 | Product-market fit | 10K engaged users |
| **2. Internal Platform** | Mo 6-12 | Build infrastructure | 50% with 2+ integrations |
| **3. Developer Beta** | Mo 12-18 | Validate demand | 20 design partners |
| **4. Public Platform** | Mo 18-24 | Ecosystem flywheel | 100 integrations |
| **5. Enterprise** | Mo 24+ | B2B revenue | $1M ARR |

---

## Competitive Position

| They Build | We Build |
|------------|----------|
| Assistants that execute | Memory that understands |
| Shallow convenience features | Deep personal context |
| Locked-in memory | Portable memory passport |
| Developer infrastructure only | Consumer product + platform |

---

## Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Target % |
|----------------|----------|
| Consumer Subscriptions | 40% |
| API Usage | 30% |
| Enterprise Contracts | 30% |

**Target Gross Margin:** 65-75%

## The Big Bet

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is the integration layer.

Inscript becomes the canonical "personal context" MCP server. When users connect Inscript to Claude, ChatGPT, or any MCP-compatible AI, their memory travels with them.

---

## Decision Filter

Before building anything, ask:

1. Does this build **trust**?
2. Does this deepen **memory**?
3. Does this move us toward **platform**?
4. Can users **export** this data?
5. Would we be **proud** to explain this publicly?

If any answer is no, reconsider.

## 10-Year Vision

> **Every AI in the world knows you through Inscript.**
