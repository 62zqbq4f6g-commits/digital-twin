CRITICAL FIX: Feedback not persisting after cache clear

TWO ISSUES:

1. FEEDBACK SYNC: Approved/Rejected lost after cache wipe
   - note.feedback.rating MUST be included in Supabase sync payload
   - On app load, if local notes have no feedback but cloud does, restore it
   - Debug: console.log the sync payload to verify feedback is included
   - TEST: approve 5 notes → clear cache → reload → all 5 still highlighted

2. OUTPUT QUALITY COUNT: Resets to 1 approved after cache wipe
   - Count is only reading local data before cloud sync completes
   - Wait for sync to complete, THEN count feedback
   - Or: fetch count directly from Supabase
   - TEST: approve 5 notes → clear cache → reload → shows "5 approved"

Deploy and output FEEDBACK-SYNC-FIXED
