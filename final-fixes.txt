DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - black/white/gray only.

THREE FIXES:

1. QUESTIONANSWER CLOUD SYNC: Still not surviving cache clear
   - Debug: Log what's being sent to Supabase
   - Verify note.questionAnswer is in the sync payload
   - On app load, if local questionAnswer is empty but cloud has it, restore it
   - TEST: answer question → clear cache → reload → answer MUST be visible

2. COMMENT INDICATOR: User cannot see which notes have comments
   - In notes list, show small indicator if note has feedback.comment
   - In note detail, show saved comment visibly below COMMENT button
   - Format: "Your comment: [text]" with subtle styling
   - User should know at a glance which notes they commented on

3. DECISION BUTTON STYLING: Should match Approve/Reject style
   - Currently: outlined box when selected
   - Should be: filled/shaded box when selected (like Approve/Reject)
   - When Still Thinking selected: black background, white text
   - When Decided selected: black background, white text
   - Unselected: white background, black text/border
