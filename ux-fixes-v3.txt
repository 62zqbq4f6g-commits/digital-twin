DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - clean, elegant, typography-forward, black/white/gray only.

FIXES:

1. OUTPUT QUALITY LABELS: In Twin tab
   - Change "liked" to "approved"
   - Change "disliked" to "rejected"
   - Fix count - should show ALL approved notes, not just 1

2. ANSWER CLOUD SYNC: questionAnswer must survive cache clear
   - When answer submitted, save to Supabase immediately
   - On app load, restore questionAnswer from cloud
   - Verify note.questionAnswer is included in sync payload
   - Test: answer question, clear cache, reload - answer must show

3. COMMENT STORAGE: Ensure comment is stored and synced
   - Save to note.feedback.comment in IndexedDB
   - Sync to Supabase
   - Restore on app load
   - This data will be used for learning

4. DECISION TOGGLE: Allow deselecting both buttons
   - If Decided is selected, clicking Decided again = deselect (no selection)
   - If Still Thinking is selected, clicking it again = deselect
   - User can have NO selection (neither button highlighted)
   - Remove toast messages "Decision made" / "Decision opened" - just toggle silently

5. TWIN TAB TEXT: Update header text
   - Change "Your Twin" to "Your Living Script"
   - Change "Learning who you are from your notes" to "a mirror in code" in lowercase

Deploy and output UX-V3-COMPLETE
