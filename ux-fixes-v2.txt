DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - clean, elegant, typography-forward, black/white/gray only.

CRITICAL FIXES:

1. CLOUD SYNC FOR FEEDBACK: Approve/Reject must restore after cache clear
   - Save feedback to Supabase immediately on click
   - On app load, if local empty, fetch feedback from cloud
   - Test: approve note, clear cache, reload - approval should show

2. ANSWER NOT SAVING: When user answers a question via ANSWER button:
   - Save to note.questionAnswer in IndexedDB AND Supabase
   - Display saved answer below the question
   - Persist across cache clears
   - Show "Your answer:" with the saved text

3. BUTTON CLARIFICATION:
   - ANSWER button = respond to AI question (already exists, just fix persistence)
   - COMMENT button = add a comment/note about the rating (like a review note)
   - Both should work independently

4. DETECTING PATTERNS ANIMATION: When button shows "Detecting patterns..."
   - Add animated ellipsis: "Detecting patterns" → "Detecting patterns." → "Detecting patterns.." → "Detecting patterns..."
   - Or add a subtle pulse/spinner
   - User must feel progress is happening

5. DECISION TOGGLE FIX: Still Thinking / Decided buttons
   - Should ALWAYS be toggleable
   - Clicking Decided once = selected, click again = deselected
   - User can switch between Still Thinking and Decided freely
   - Never lock the user out of changing their mind
   - Visually highlight current selection only
