DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - clean, elegant, typography-forward, black/white/gray only, no clutter.

Data persistence bugs to fix:

1. TOAST DELAY: showToast appears 3-5s late. Should be instant. Check if await is blocking it.

2. FEEDBACK NOT PERSISTING: When user clicks Approve/Reject, it should:
   - Save immediately to note.feedback in IndexedDB
   - Show visually which button was selected (highlight or checkmark)
   - Persist across page reloads

3. COMMENT NOT WORKING: Comment button should open input, save to note.questionAnswer, persist across sessions

4. PATTERNS NOT PERSISTING: Profile patterns should load from database on app start, not require rebuild every time

5. Check cloud sync is working - data should survive cache clears

Test: Approve a note, refresh page, button should still show as selected.

Deploy and output PERSISTENCE-FIXED
