DESIGN: Vogue minimalist - black/white/gray only.

PHOTO UPLOAD FIX:

Error: "failed to process image"

Debug steps:
1. Check if Vision API endpoint exists and is correct
2. Check if API key is configured for vision
3. Check if image is being converted to base64 correctly
4. Check if the request payload format is correct for Claude Vision API

Common issues:
- API endpoint might be wrong
- Image might be too large (resize before sending)
- Base64 encoding might be malformed
- Content-type header might be wrong

Add better error logging to show EXACT error from API response.

TEST: tap image → select photo → note creates with analysis

Deploy and output PHOTO-FIXED
