Two fixes needed:

1. Remove the COPY FOR TEAM button from note detail view in js/ui.js - it is redundant since Copy button already exists

2. Verify showToast is called when user clicks Approve, Reject, or Copy buttons - should show brief confirmation like "Approved" or "Copied"

Deploy when done. Output BUGFIX-COMPLETE when finished.
